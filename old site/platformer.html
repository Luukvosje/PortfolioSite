                <h1>Information</h1>
                <p>For a recent school assignment, I designed a platformer game akin to the iconic Mario series. Given
                    my limited artistic abilities, I opted to craft the game using simple square elements. The unique
                    twist I incorporated into the gameplay was that it would be played on an arcade cabinet equipped
                    with two joysticks, offering a distinctive gaming experience.</p>
                <p>The left joystick was designated for character movement, allowing players to navigate their character
                    across the platformed world. Meanwhile, the right joystick served as a control for aiming, adding an
                    extra layer of challenge and interaction.</p>
                <p>One of the defining mechanics of my game was that players could only jump if they possessed a bullet.
                    Shooting the bullet would consume it, and players needed to retrieve it in order to continue
                    jumping. This dynamic added a delightful layer of complexity, making the game simultaneously
                    enjoyable and challenging for players.</p>
                <p>This combination of straightforward square-based visuals, dual joystick controls, and the unique
                    bullet-jumping mechanism resulted in a game that provided an engaging and amusing experience on the
                    arcade cabinet, sure to captivate players with its blend of simplicity and complexity.
